ActiveProbing intermittently pings Microsoft's Servers to check for a network connection.
Some applications require this to be enabled to recognise that they have an internet connection.
Disable it for maximum privacy. Although, disabling it may cause the network icon to display a disconnected icon while you still have a stable connection.
